# 572_Project_1

Matlab Version: R2019b Update 9.7.0

## Requirements
a) Extract 4 different types of time series features from only the CGM data cell array and CGM
timestamp cell array.
b) For each time series explain why you chose such feature.
c) Show values of each of the features and argue that your intuition in step b is validated or
disproved?
d) Create a feature matrix where each row is a collection of features from each time series. SO if
there are 75 time series and your feature length after concatenation of the 4 types of featues is
17 then the feature matrix size will be 75 * 17.
e) Provide this feature matrix to PCA and derive the new feature matrix. Chose the top 5 features
and plot them for each time series.
f) For each feature in the top 5 argue why it is chosen as a top five feature in PCA?
